Tao was conceived and developed by Mark Pearson, initially
as part of a PhD at the University of York (1993-1996) then
subsequently at the Australian Centre for the Arts and 
Technology, who kindly provided equipment and an office for
a year (1997-1998). Since then Tao has been developed mainly
at home when time permits.
