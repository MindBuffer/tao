<H2>Deficiencies in Tao's synthesis language</H2>

<B>Tao</B>'s synthesis language was developed primarily as a test-bed for the synthesis
engine. It has evolved into a usable language but lacks several features for
larger scale compositional work including:
<UL><LI>Encapsulation of events
<LI>Encapsulation of instrument components
<LI>Table generating and reading functions
</UL>
<P>What is meant by `encapsulation of events' is the ability to describe a
complex algorithm for producing some kind of high-level event and then
place this algorithm inside a black box with input parameters. The
algorithm would then be invoked whenever it was needed
(much like a C or C++ function) using just its name and arguments.
The addition of this feature would make it a much simpler matter to
produce complex multi-layered textures of sound.
<P>Encapsulation as applied to instruments refers to the ability to create
compound instruments where the components of the instrument are arranged
hierarchically with parent-child relationships. For example an instrument
named `guitar' might have child components named `string1', `string2'
etc. In order to achieve this the syntax of <B>Tao</B>'s synthesis language
would need to be modified to allow components to be created within the
scope of other components, much as local variables may be declared
within C or C++ functions.
<P>It would also be possible to describe template instruments which would
act as templates for whole families of instruments with similar
characteristics. For example the description of a `guitar' template
instrument would allow the construction of multiple instances each
having their own body sizes and string tunings, but with aspects of
the physical structure common to each instance.
<P>Table reading functions are an essential part of any synthesis program
and the only way they can be implemented at the moment is by setting
up arrays of values by hand and accessing (and interpolating them)
yourself with parameters declared in the script. Of course all the 
math library functions are available in the synthesis language so it
is feasible to write table initialisation code in the Init part of
the score, but it is still cumbersome compared with <CODE>Csound</CODE>'s
provision of table generating features.
