<H3>Cell Attributes</H3>

The most important <EM>attributes</EM><A NAME="1"> maintained</A> by each cell are its
<CODE>mass</CODE>, <CODE>position</CODE>, <CODE>velocity</CODE>, 
<CODE>force</CODE> and lastly <CODE>velocityMultiplier</CODE>. Not
surprisingly these are used to keep track of the cell's state of motion
and the forces acting upon it. The <CODE><CODE>Cell</CODE></CODE> class is unusual in
that it is seldom dealt with directly. However we will see that many
of <B>Tao</B>'s other classes have attributes which are often accessed
and set via <EM>methods</EM><A NAME="2">&nbsp;</A>
<P>The <CODE>velocityMultiplier</CODE> attribute is quite important. It holds
a value in the range [0..1] and the velocity of the cell is multiplied
by this value on each tick. This has the effect of dissipating energy (if the
value is <I>&lt;</I> 1) and thus damping the vibrations of the cell. Each cell
can have a different value for this attribute leading to non-uniform
damping of the material and this feature is a very important tool for
controlling the vibrational characteristics of the material as we will
see later on in this manual. 
<P>For example with a simple string-like instrument consisting of a single row
of cells linked together with springs, damping small regions at either end
of the string more highly than the rest of the cells
causes the higher frequency vibrations to die away more quickly than the
lower ones. This leads to a more natural string-like spectral decay in the
sounds produced by the instrument, whereas a string with uniform damping
exhibits no significant change in the distribution of spectral energy as
the sound evolves. 
<P>It is probably safe to say that all physically produced sounds
exhibit some kind of spectral evolution, and as a general rule
non-uniform damping always produces more interesting sounds from
<B>Tao</B> instruments than uniform damping.
<P>The other main attributes that each cell maintains are pointers to its
neighbours <CODE>north</CODE>, <CODE>east</CODE>, <CODE>south</CODE>,
<CODE>west</CODE>, <CODE>neast</CODE>, <CODE>nwest</CODE>, <CODE>seast</CODE>
and <CODE>swest</CODE>. Each pointer indicates to a particular cell that
it is connected to a neighbouring cell via a virtual spring. Similarly the
neighbouring cell will reciprocate by keeping a pointer to the first. You do
not need to deal with these pointers directly as an end-user <B>Tao</B> but it
is worth knowing that they are there. 
<P>The final attribute is used to store other aspects of the cell's state,
such as whether it is locked or free to move. This attribute is called
<CODE>mode</CODE>.
